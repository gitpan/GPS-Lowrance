NAME
    GPS::Lowrance - Connect to Lowrance and Eagle GPS devices

REQUIREMENTS
    The following modules are required to use this module:

      Carp::Assert
      Parse::Binary::FixedFormat
      GPS::Lowrance::LSI
      GPS::Lowrance::Trail
      Win32::SerialPort or Device::SerialPort

    This module should work with Perl 5.6.x. It has been tested on Perl
    5.8.2.

  Installation
    Installation is standard:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

    For Windows playforms, you may need to use "nmake" instead.

SYNOPSIS
      use GPS::Lowrance;
      use GPS::Lowrace::Trail;

      $gps = GPS::Lowrance->connect(
                Device     => 'com1',
                BaudRate   => 57600,
              );

      $trail = $gps->get_plot_trail( plot_trail_number => 0 );

      $gps->disconnect;

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a variety of higher-level methods for communicating
    with Lowrance and Eagle GPS receivers.

    This is an experimental module with only a partial implementation to
    read data from the device.  It is documented, however.

    More detailed information can be found in the POD.
    
CAVEATS
    This is a beta version of the module, so there are bound to be some
    bugs. In the current form it is also far from complete.

    This module was tested with "Win32::SerialPort", although it should use
    "Device::SerialPort" on non-Windows platforms. However, this has not yet
    been tested.

  Known Issues
    The protocol uses little-endian values, and due to some quirks in the
    decoding functions, they may not be converted properly on big-endian
    machines.
