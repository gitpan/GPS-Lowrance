SYNOPSIS
      use GPS::Lowrance;
      use GPS::Lowrance::Trail;

                Device     => 'com1',
                BaudRate   => 57600,
              );

      $trail = $gps->get_plot_trail( plot_trail_number => 0 );

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a variety of higher-level methods for communicating
    with Lowrance and Eagle GPS receivers.

    This is an experimental module with only a partial implementation to
    read data from the device.  It is documented, however.

    More detailed information can be found in the POD.

    Examples can be found in the "eg" directory in this package.
    
CAVEATS
    This is a beta version of the module, so there are bound to be some
    bugs. In the current form it is also far from complete.

    See the module documentation for a complete list of Known Issues.

  Compatability
    This module should work with all Lowrance and Eagle devices which
    support the LSI 100 protocol.  It has been tested on the following
    model(s):

      Lowrance GlobalMap 100 (same as Eagle MapGuide Pro?)

    If you have tested it on other models, please notify me.
