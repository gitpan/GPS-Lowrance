NAME
    GPS::Lowrance - Connect to Lowrance and Eagle GPS devices

REQUIREMENTS
    The following non-standard modules are required to use this
    module:

      Carp::Assert
      GPS::Lowrance::LSI
      Parse::Binary::FixedFormat
      Win32::SerialPort or Device::SerialPort

    To extract trails or waypoints you will need the following
    modues:

      Geo::Coordinates::DecimalDegrees
      Geo::Coordinates::UTM
      XML::Generator
      GPS::Lowrance::Trail

    If you want to use the screen capture or icon download functions,
    you also need the following module:

      GD

    This module should work with Perl 5.6.x. It has been tested on Perl
    5.8.2.

  Installation
    Installation can be done using the traditional Makefile.PL or the
    newer Build.PL methods.

    Using Makefile.PL:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

    (On Windows platforms you should use nmake instead.)

    Using Build.PL (if you have Module::Build installed):

      perl Build.PL
      perl Build
      perl Build test
      perl Build install    

SYNOPSIS
      use GPS::Lowrance;
      use GPS::Lowrance::Trail;

      $gps = GPS::Lowrance->connect(
                Device     => 'com1',
                BaudRate   => 57600,
              );

      $trail = $gps->get_plot_trail( plot_trail_number => 0 );

      $gps->disconnect;

REVISION HISTORY
    Changes to this package since v0.21:

    0.30  Mon 29 Mar 2004
	- assertions disabled
	- MAX_BYTES uses GPS::Lowrance::LSI constant
	- fix: added trapping in get_current_screen so that if a memory read
	  fails, the GPS won't lock up
	- incorporated wrappers in GPS::Lowrance for get_current_screen
          and get_graphical_symbol from GPS::Lowrance::Screen
        - minor reorganization of code in GPS::Lowrance::Screen
	- uses Build.PL script to generate Makefile.PL and run installs
        - reorganized AutoLoading in some routines
	- GPS::Lowrance::Waypoint gives warnings about gdm16 format
	- added set_plot_trail_mercator_meters and made set_plot_trail
	  a wrapper which converts from decimal degrees
	- added get_plot_trail_mercator_meters and made get_plot_trail
          a wrapper which converts to decimal degrees
	* uses GPS::Lowrance::Trail 0.41 which allows rounding to be disabled
	* upload-trail and download trail use GPS::Lowrance::Trail 0.41	  
	- modules that are not immediately required are not used



DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a variety of higher-level methods for communicating
    with Lowrance and Eagle GPS receivers.

    This is an experimental module with only a partial implementation to
    read data from the device.  It is documented, however.

    More detailed information can be found in the POD.

    Examples can be found in the "eg" directory in this package.
    
CAVEATS
    This is a beta version of the module, so there are bound to be some
    bugs. In the current form it is also far from complete.

    I am also working with authors of other GPS::* modules to standard-
    ize the interface and input/output formats.  There may well be
    major changes in future versions.

    See the module documentation for a complete list of Known Issues.

  Compatability
    This module should work with all Lowrance and Eagle devices which
    support the LSI 100 protocol.  It has been tested on the following
    model(s):

      Lowrance GlobalMap 100 (same as Eagle MapGuide Pro?)

    If you have tested it on other models, please notify me.
